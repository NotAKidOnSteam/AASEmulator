# AASEmulator

A debug tool that makes it a bit nicer to test your ChilloutVR avatars in the Unity Editor.

It is mostly fluff. What you see is what you get:

## GUI Features
* Scrolling on dropdowns to advance sliders.
* Funni joystick, can test normalized movement values.

## Emulator "Features"
* Info display for Emote, Eye, Blink, and Lipsync status.
* Core parameters take priority from Emulator, but user-added parameters can be set in Animator and displayed in Emulator just fine.

## Emulated Quirks
* Emote parameter is only set for one frame.
* Emote is reset while running.
* Emote status is based on Locomotion/Emotes animation clip names.

That's really it as of now. Possible goal is to get CVRParameterStream, CVRAdvancedAvatarSettingTrigger, and CVRPointer emulated i guess.

Some utility functions as well as the main inspiration for the "Emulator" part & structure. Not much is applicable to ChilloutVR or its CCK.
